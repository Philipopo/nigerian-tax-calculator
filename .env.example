# ===========================================
# ADDITIONAL NOTES
# ===========================================
#
# SECURITY BEST PRACTICES:
# ✓ Never commit .env.local to version control
# ✓ Use different credentials for development, staging, and production
# ✓ Rotate keys regularly, especially if exposed
# ✓ Use test/sandbox keys during development
# ✓ Keep server-side keys (without NEXT_PUBLIC_) truly secret
#
# TESTING:
# - All payment gateways provide test/sandbox environments
# - Use test keys during development to avoid real charges
# - Switch to live keys only when ready for production
